          Valid combinations are:
          - `/api/clients` (all clients)
          - `/api/clients/my_client` (client identical to `my_client`)

          Items may be updated by replacing them. `{type}`, `{kind}`, and `{item}` are required.
          
          Ensure to send all the required parameters (such as `description`) to ensure these properties are retained.
          The read-only fields `id` and `date_added` are preserved, `date_modified` is automatically updated on success.

          You can move existing items to another list type/kind by `PUT`ting the item to the new destination by specifying the optional fields `oldtype` and `oldkind`. Example:
          You can use `PUT allow/exact/abc.com` with `oldtype="deny", oldkind="exact"` to change `abc.com` from exact denied to exact allowed. Make sure to always specify *both* values.

          When replacing a regular expression, ensure that `{item}` body is properly URI-escaped.

        summary: Add new client
        description: |
          Creates a new client in the `clients` object. The `{client}` itself is specified in the request body (POST JSON).

          Clients may be described either by their IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6 are supported),
          IP subnets (CIDR notation, like `192.168.2.0/24`), their MAC addresses (like `12:34:56:78:9A:BC`), by their hostnames (like `localhost`), or by the interface they are connected to (prefaced with a colon, like `:eth0`).</p>

          Note that client recognition by IP addresses (incl. subnet ranges) is prefered over MAC address, host name or interface recognition as the two latter will only be available after some time.
          Furthermore, MAC address recognition only works for devices at most one networking hop away from your Pi-hole.

          On success, a new ressource is created at `/clients/{client}`.

          The `database_error` with message `UNIQUE contraint failed` error indicates that this client already exists.
